# Our Story and Startup

SHOPYLL is a startup by Malik Mehrose and his teammates Malik Musaib and Aashiq Hassan with having a dream to build Kashmirâ€™s own online-based shopping platform, where customers can purchase any product at wholesale price without having any middlemen and extra charges.

We aim to develop the SHOPYLL platform as the ultimate website where everybody can purchase products from Food to Clothes at very affordable prices with a single click and get the product at their doorsteps.

Presently we have started with a narrow range of products but we are continuously working hard to add more products and categories on our website and we are also extending the range of home delivery to various areas ðŸšš.

We also provide B2B services of various Kashmiri Homemade products, if want to place any B2B order contact us.
